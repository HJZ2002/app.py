üöÄ Running the Application
To get started with the application:

Install the required dependencies:

bash


pip install flask werkzeug pyjwt flask-cors
Ensure SQLite is available
SQLite is used as the database. Most systems come with it pre-installed. If not, install it based on your OS.

Run the application:

bash


python app.py
Access the web interface:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

üõ† Deployment
You can deploy the application using any of the following methods:

LocalXpose
For temporary public access during development or demonstration, use LocalXpose to expose your localhost via an HTTP tunnel.

Apache with mod_wsgi
Ideal for production environments using traditional server stacks. Configure WSGI to serve the Flask app via Apache.

Gunicorn or Waitress
Use these WSGI servers to serve the app in production-grade environments, especially when paired with a reverse proxy like Nginx.

üóÉ Database Structure
Users Table

Manages user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC)

Stores hashed passwords securely using werkzeug.security

LaundryItems Table

Tracks laundry orders and item statuses

Contains customer information, timestamps, and order progress indicators
